| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Sandbox scene | Sandbox scene is provided and functional (and, I don’t remember if I’ve mentioned it already, but very fittingly named!). You are the Testing Queens 🎶💃🏾 | 10/10 |
| | **_pitch.md_** | |
| • Use case | Final scene is entertainingly described. Would you like to build a shader man? | 3/3 |
| • Animation | Autonomous animation(s) are stated | 3/3 |
| • Interaction | Interactions are stated | 3/3 |
| | **Autonomous animation** | |
| • Use case | Autonomous animation fits the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Autonomous animation differs from starter code |  |
| • Implementation | No serious animation implementation issues seen | 8/8 |
| | **Interaction** | |
| • Use case | Interaction fits the use case | 4/4 |
| • Starter code difference | Interaction differs from starter code |  |
| • Implementation | No serious interaction implementation issues seen | 8/8 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Use case | Lighting choices fit the use case | 4/4 |
| • Implementation | The lighting feedback from the previous assignment still applies but we won’t re-deduct those. If you eventually fix them I think you’ll find the lighting behavior to feel more consistent | 8/8 |
| | **Technical milestones** | |
| • Camera | Camera settings appear to change as intended | 7/7 |
| • Wireframe/solid | Wireframe and solid rendering appear to change as intended | 7/7 |
| • Projection | Projection matrix appears to change as intended, with intended settings | 7/7 |
| • Aspect ratio | Canvas aspect ratio is manually coordinated with the viewing volume for orthographic projection, but not for perspective projection, which is just slightly off (square vs. 8:7 for the canvas) (–1) | 6/7 |
| • Scene add/remove | Scene add/remove appears to work as intended | 7/7 |
| • Group add/remove | Group add/remove appears to work as intended | 7/7 |
| • Faceted/smooth | Changing between faceted and smooth looks appears to work as intended, though it would have been nice if the scene had a button for that (I added it manually to make sure that it worked) (–1) | 7/8 |
| _credits.md_ | _credits.md_ sufficiently describes who let it go | 10/10 |
| Custom instructions | Custom setup/installation instructions not necessary |  |
| _commentary.md_ | Commentary provides answers to all five questions, and is thoughtful and detailed. Well-chosen defaults are always great to have, but underappreciated by many devs unfortunately. The winner defaults it al! 🎵 | 10/10 |
| _group-retrospective.md_ | _group-retrospective.md_ provides a detailed description of what each group member did throughout the last four assignments. Very candidly written too now that “all is said and done”—I almost feel like I was there 😁 | 5/5 |
| Additional features |  |  |
| Code maintainability | No major code maintainability issues seen |  |
| Code readability | No major code readability issues seen |  |
| Version control | Continuing good version control habits on display 👏🏼—what Super Troupers you are! |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit on 5/6 4:44pm |  |
| | **Total** | **128/130** |
