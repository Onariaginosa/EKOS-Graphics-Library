# Hello, Hello, and Welcome to my Show! 

## Setting Our Scene
Imagine you have one day woken up to a snowy landscape that seems like it has come straight out of your favorite, award-winning, Disney princess film. You are in the world of the Frozen Cinematic Universe, no matter how much you can believe it. 

As you are walking through the woods, you find yourself in an empty snowy meadow. A melodic voice breaks you from your reverie. "Are you here to see us perform?" The tiny snowman with the crooked nose asks innocently, pulling on your sleeve insistently. 

"Uh...maybe?" You're confused but intrigued. How are these snowmen moving and speaking? How did I get here?! Is this OLAF FROM THE FROZEN CINEMATIC UNIVERSE?! While you have no answers the snowman does not wait for your mind to catch up.

Olaf tugs on your hand and leads you to a stage with instruments set up and a mic in the center. There is rows and rows of foldable chairs but no one is using them. Maybe even a hundred seats? How many people did they plan on showing up in the middle of a frozen tundra? Quite impractical. The little snowmen crowd the stage and buzz with excitement. 

Olaf runs to the stage. "We've been practicing since the last Winter Solstice. My last band only snowgies, and it didn't really work out too well considering they have no arms!" He claps once and his band members spring to life. "Introducing the new and improved, Olaf and the Snowgies, minus the Snowgies!"

Olaf taps into his mic. "Hello, Hello, and Welcome to my Show!" He sings. 

This is where the show begins!

## Our Actual Scene

### User interaction
You are in the Frozen Scape waiting for the show to start. Once you click on the button Olaf and the Snowgies begin to perform. Once you click again, the song halts and they freeze on stage. If an intermission is not enough, you can make Olaf and the Snowgies take a break backstage. If you're craving more music, bring them back on stage! You can also choose to view the concert with your fellow audience members in view or without! To each their own!

### Keep Some Motion in the Ocean
The Snowgies (the audience not to be confused by the band members) are so excited that they aren't overworked and underpaid, so they can hardly contain themselves! They're dancing whether the performers are playing or not! Talk about a loyal crowd! Also the snowflakes (some tainted by the new industrial plant built by the evil King Runeard in order to build a dam before he got got in the Enchanted Forest) are rotating because they are magic!
