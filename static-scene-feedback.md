| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Stub web app | Stub web app provides testbed for scene libraryâ€”lovinâ€™ that cross-promotion! | 5/5 |
| | **Screen construct/framework** | |
| â€¢ Setup | Scene code is structured to handle WebGL setup and connection to `canvas` in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| â€¢ Add/remove | `Scene` handles addition and removal | 4/4 |
| â€¢ Rendering | Scene code renders to a canvas in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| â€¢Â Implementation | Overall things look goodâ€”clean separation, clear reusability | 3/3 |
| | **3D object framework** | |
| â€¢ Different shapes | 3D object framework accommodates different shapes | 2/2 |
| â€¢ Color | 3D object framework stores at least a single color | 2/2 |
| â€¢ Groups/composites | 3D object framework includes a proper group/composite construct | 8/8 |
| â€¢ Implementation | 3D object framework implementation is generally clear and straightforward | 3/3 |
| | **Polygon mesh data structure** | |
| â€¢ Vertices/triangles | Mesh data structure stores vertices and faces (triangles) appropriately. Faces inline vertices directlyâ€”might be an issue when computing vertex normals later, but for now it works | 10/10 |
| â€¢ Extensibility | Mesh data structure (specifically, `Composite`) is straightforward to extend | 5/5 |
| â€¢ Solid vs. wireframe | Mesh data structure produces wireframe and solid renders in a straightforward manner (good idea to cache these from the get-go!) | 5/5 |
| â€¢ Implementation | Overall mesh implementation looks clean and straightforward. A fewer layers to get through, but once assimilated it makes sense | 5/5 |
| | **Mesh maker library** | |
| â€¢Â Sphere | Sphere appears to be implemented correctly | 20* |
| â€¢Â Regular polygon | n/a |  |
| â€¢ _shape-credits.md_ | _shape-credits.md_ clearly lists who did what |  |
| â€¢ Implementation | Shape framework is overall implemented consistently and sufficiently wellâ€”thereâ€™s a slight bit of redundancy in that every shapeâ€™s constructor appears to end with the exact same three linesâ€¦if all shapes start out this way, some kind of helper might be called for in order to minimize the possibility of errors (â€“1) | 9/10 |
| Extra credit (if any) |  |  |
| Code maintainability | No major code maintainability issues seen |  |
| Code readability | No major code readability issues seen |  |
| Version control | Decent commit count with sufficiently descriptive messages. Do you use LiveShare? Hard to tell based on the commit messages ðŸ˜„ |  |
| Punctuality | Last commit before the due date is 4/5 8:41pm<br /><br /> **Graded commit:** https://github.com/lmu-cmsi371-spring2021/hw-our-3d-library-ekos/tree/d8e7017a8e87164dccbe5d4241a37d75db453e76 |  |
| | **Total** | **89/90** |

Sphere score is out of 20 for four-person groups and out of 12 for five-person groups, for whom the remaining 8 points are allocated to the regular polygon.
