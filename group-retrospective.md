# Group Retrospective

## Overall Group Dynamic
Since we all have been friends since CSSI 2018, we were very comfortable and confident in working with each other. We have worked with each other on many assignments so we were well aware of each other's working habits. We also have very similar school schedules and thus, it was easier to arrange meetings with each other. It was also nice because we were easily able to slip in between work mode and having fun with each other!

## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 was a lot for our group, but we are glad that we structured everything in their own individual classes. This made creating our scene much easier. At this point we had structured several inner classes, like the Shape class, the Shell class, and used them in our more visible outer classes, like Composite and Group. We also moved our Scene into it's own class. This removed a lot of duplicate code from our scene. Initially we were worried about losing customizability in our scene, but then we created the scene class to have a ton of optional parameters where they could customized if the user chooses. If they wanted an easy experience, they could also just not change the defaults, which was nice. 

## Assignment 2 
Assignment 2 was kinda a hot mess for us as well, because we kinda messed up on some of our matrices, but didn't realize it until later because we also manually calculated the tests incorrectly, because we read the matrices in the wrong order ðŸ˜…. Especially the projection matrix. That was painful.

## Assignment 3
Assignment 3 was also a hot mess in a way because this was when we figured out that some of our matrices were wrong. In essence we had to low-key redo part of assignment 2 as well as creating the camera, and lighting aspects. Because we had made all of our shapes go through the shape class, it was relatively easy to calculate the normals for a given shape. We also customized our composite and group classes to choose whether they want smooth vertex normals or faceted ones. We also customized our camera class so that the user can choose how large they want the universe to be, as well as which projection matrix they would like to use, and their near and far planes. We also created a diffuse lighting class where someone could add lighting and choose their location for the light, however, it became rough because we weren't sure how to programatically add multiple lights to a scene, but oh well! 

## Assignment 4
For Assignment 4, all group members were assigned a specific character and instrument to build for our band scene. Each character has some form of movement that starts when the user interacts with the scene. As a group, we worked on the background set pieces. Additionally, we worked together to figure out how to use Tween.js with our code in order to make the animation process easier.
